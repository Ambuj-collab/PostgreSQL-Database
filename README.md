# What is a connection pool?
Connection pooling refers to reusage of existing pre-established connections to make HTTP requests, rather than creating a new connection for each service request, be it a connection of accessing remote REST API endpoint, or a backend database instance. Connection pooling can help to improve the performance of an application by reducing the overhead of establishing new connections, particularly for applications that make many HTTP requests concurrently.
